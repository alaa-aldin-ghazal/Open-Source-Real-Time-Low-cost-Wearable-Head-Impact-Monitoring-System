Mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI) is a significant health concern that can occur due to
rapid head movements during activities such as contact sports, motor vehicle
accidents, industrial mishaps, falls, and combat situations. These events can lead to
cellular and chemical changes in the brain, disrupting neural pathways and causing
symptoms such as headaches, dizziness, cognitive difficulties, and emotional changes.
Raising awareness about mTBI and implementing preventive measures to reduce its
incidence and mitigate its impact on affected individuals is crucial. Head kinematics
measurement is one of the quickest methods for making on-field initial diagnosis
decisions. This paper describes the development of an open-source, low-cost, realtime
device that can be attached to a helmet. It monitors the head kinematics data
(linear acceleration and rotational speed) and sending it over a Wi-Fi connection to a
web browser of a monitor device (PC or Mobile phone) connected to the same network
so the user who observes the data can call a doctor to check mTBI symptoms. The
device utilizes an inertial measurement unit (IMU) and high-g (g = 9.8 m/s2) linear
accelerometers interfaced with an Internet of Things (IoT) based microcontroller
(WeMos D1 Mini) programmed using the Arduino IDE. This setup facilitates data
visualization through an interactive HTML webpage, enabling the user (e.g., coach,
medical personnel) to assess the data and potentially recommend seeking medical
attention if concerning readings are observed. The application of this device can be in
different areas such as road accidents, contact sports, military, and mine workers.
